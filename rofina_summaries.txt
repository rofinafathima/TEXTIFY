=== New Summary ===
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a multidisciplinary field that empowers computers and machines to mimic abilities traditionally associated with human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, and problem-solving. At its core, AI leverages enormous datasets and sophisticated algorithms to extract patterns, gain insights, and make autonomous decisions or predictions that once required human intervention. Important subfields within AI include machine learning (where systems learn and adapt through data exposure), generative AI (which creates new content), natural language processing (enabling machines to understand and communicate in human language), and expert systems that simulate decision-making by specialists. In healthcare, it aids doctors in diagnosing diseases, discovering drugs, and tailoring treatment plans by analyzing vast collections of patient data. Financial institutions use AI for smarter fraud detection, risk management, and personalized financial advice. In manufacturing, AI enables predictive maintenance, autonomous robots, and quality control, saving immense labor and improving efficiency. Even in agriculture and transportation, AI helps monitor crops, increase productivity, manage logistics, and power self-driving vehicles.
