Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most transformative technologies of the 21st century, designed to make machines think, learn, and act like humans. It is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence. These tasks include learning from experience, recognizing patterns, understanding natural language, solving problems, and making decisions. The concept of AI began decades ago, but it has evolved rapidly in recent years due to advancements in computing power, data availability, and algorithms. Today, AI is everywhere — in smartphones, social media, healthcare, finance, education, and even entertainment. Virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant use AI to understand voice commands and respond intelligently. In healthcare, AI helps doctors detect diseases, analyze medical images, and predict treatment outcomes. In finance, it detects fraudulent transactions and manages investments with high accuracy. Machine learning, a subset of AI, allows computers to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning, which mimics the structure of the human brain through neural networks, enables systems to process large amounts of complex information such as images and speech. Another growing area is natural language processing (NLP), which allows computers to understand and generate human language.
